# react-checkout
deploy version of react-shopping-cart




- I'm just going to take the example as an inspiration and just make a quick mock-up of my own.

- order summary on right
  - subtotal
  - delivery
  - estimated tax (add .47 for every item)
  - total

- shopping cart items on left
- two items with add/remove buttons
- shows subtotal


- uses findIndex to search through state.


- So, mounting is different than rendering.
